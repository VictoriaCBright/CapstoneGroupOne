            <h3>5 Common Mistakes adopters make when bringing home a new dog</h3>
            <section class="panelContent">
              <br>
                <p>Everyone knows that adopting a dog from a shelter saves animals’ lives and makes us all feel good. At any time of year, but especially around the holidays, social media feeds are packed with heartwarming stories of shelters adopting out large numbers of dogs to their forever homes. It’s feel-good central and we eat it up.</p>

            <h3>Keep Your Pet Inside</h3>
            <section class="panelContent">
              <br>
                <p>Most often, a dog who escapes is a dog who has not had time to bond with his family indoors. No matter how highyou build your fence or how sturdy you build your pen, keeping your dog confined will be a constant battle unlessyou take the time to improve your relationship with him indoors. There are also dogs that love their families andbeing indoors but will “jump” at the opportunity to meet a new friend.
                  OUTDOOR BARRIERS
                  There are all sorts of ways to physically confine your dog to your property outside. Here are some examples:• Build a taller fence or add taller extensions.• Install inward facing brackets at the top of your fence and string deer netting between the brackets.• Install a “roll bar” on top of your fence.• Add visual barrier strips to your cyclone fencing.• Plant wide shrubs inside your fence.• Install a shorter fence a few feet in from your existing fence.• Build an outside pen with a brick or cement border at the base and a wire top.• Install an underground wire fence with your visible fence.</p>

            <h3>Introducing Your New Pet To Others</h3>
            <section class="panelContent">
              <br>
                <p>Avoid introducing your current pet to your new dog on his or her first night home. Instead, establish a nice,cozy, safe room where your pet can rest when he needs to be away from everything before bringing in yournew pet. Make sure the room includes food, water, toys, appropriate chewable items, and a nice soft bed.Make sure the room also has a solid door for those times when they may want absolutely no interaction withthe new member of the family.</p>

            <h3>Bonding</h3>
            <section class="panelContent">
              <br>
                <p>The primary relationship you will want to build when introducing any new pet to your home is your pet's relationship with you. Their relationship with your new pet will grow with time, but he has to trust you from the beginning. So spend time with your pet in their “safe” room just relaxing with him well before your new pet joins your household. Use this room to confine your dog during periods your new pet is exploring her newterritory.
